**Project Proposal**

Student Name/-s: Xichong Ling, Di Zhuang

# Motivational Image

_Include and describe your motivational image, how it conforms to this year's
theme and how the selected features will help to achieve that_

<img src="/images/motivation2.jpg" alt="Motivational image" class="img-responsive">

# Selected Features

Please fill out the tables while following the given structure as much as possible. Please remove this text, "2.1 Example", and "2.3 Student #2" (if you do not work in a group)
The initial impression of the image suggests a mysterious scene setting of wilderness, yet upon 
closer examination, one discovers that the apparent natural landscape is, in fact, an intricately detailed 
wallpaper, and the prominent black sheep is merely an inert model. This optical illusion aligns 
with the thematic essence of "the more you look," as it reveals a layered and nuanced reality that 
diverges from the initial perception.
**
There are some features coming into handy when designing this interesting scene. Participating media in the room can add up to the cryptic
atmosphere; depth of field is always helpful when creating aesthetic images.

Depth of Field: comparing results with Mitsuba, with same scene setting and camera parameters
**
Modeling Meshes: a pipeline work, visually verified by the Blender rendered results
**
Features related to Volume rendering: validation based on results comparation with Mitsuba and pbrt, visual comparing results with different/without Media
