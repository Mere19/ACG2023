**Project Proposal**

Student Name/-s: Xichong Ling, Di Zhuang

# Motivational Image


<img src="images/motivation2.png" alt="Motivational image" class="img-responsive">
****
The initial impression of the image suggests a mysterious scene setting of wilderness, yet upon 
closer examination, one discovers that the apparent natural landscape is, in fact, an intricately detailed 
wallpaper, and the prominent black sheep is merely an inert model. This optical illusion aligns 
with the thematic essence of "the more you look," as it reveals a layered and nuanced reality that 
diverges from the initial perception.

# Selected Features

There are some features coming into handy when designing this interesting scene. Participating media in the room can add to the cryptic
atmosphere; depth of field is always helpful when creating aesthetic images. In order to add dimensions to the results we will try applying textures on the walls and the floor, and constructing
more authentic bsdfs on object surfaces. We also choose some auxilary features like denoising and mipmapping to enhance the rendering performance.

Depth of Field: comparing results with Mitsuba, with same scene setting and camera parameters
**
Modeling Meshes: a pipeline work, visually verified by the Blender rendered results
**
Features related to Volume rendering: validation based on results comparation with Mitsuba and pbrt, visual comparing results with different/without Media
